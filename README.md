# Value-Project

This was one of the first exercise projects that I was practicing python. In this project I built a very simple value portfolio using metricks like "priceToSales" using the IEX Cloud API and writing them into an excel file. This exercise was from freeCodeCamp youtube channel if I remember correctly
